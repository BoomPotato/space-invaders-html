# space-invaders-html

Space Invaders but in html and js, and of very bad quality.

Project started on 7 Oct 2023.
I didn't think it would be complex when I first started, so I didn't create a repo until 2 days later. That's why there's a folder called <b>code-backups</b> where I dumped all my old code. But maybe it isn't complex and I'm just dumb/a noob (lol).

I tried making the game in Unity a while back but I couldn't figure out how to get the invaders to move downwards whenever they hit a border, and they kept teleporting through the borders cuz I didn't know how to use the movement coordinates thingy (sorry I forgot what it's called). So I gave up :'D

Here's to hoping I can finish this one.
~and that it doesn't end up in my growing pile of unfinished projects~
