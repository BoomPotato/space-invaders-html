1) Don't use image files for sprites. Instead, colour them dynamically using css
  because using image files with grid cells is inflexible because the images and 
  grids will have fixed widths and heights (grid uses a template).

      Not doing this cuz too difficult, may require advanced css knowledge.
      Proceeding with initial image files.
